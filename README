I created this a long time ago. The idea was to generate HTML-based printable text-only Magic: the Gathering card proxies to use for playtesting or whatever. You'd provide the complete M:tG card library in XML format, and then give a list of proxies, and the code would spit out some printer friendly XML. Matching was used using Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance to make spelling not so important. It was never fast enough for my liking, so I never finished it -- it only produces some unformatted plain-text.

XMLs are kinda obsolete these days. JSONs are far easier to work with, and very easy to find (https://mtgjson.com). I probably won't revive this project, but if i did (or you want to) def use JSONs.
